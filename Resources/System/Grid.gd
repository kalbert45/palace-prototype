# Makes the `grid_position` fit within the grid's bounds.
# This is a clamp function designed specifically for our grid coordinates.
# The Vector2 class comes with its `Vector2.clamp()` method, but it doesn't work the same way: it
# limits the vector's length instead of clamping each of the vector's components individually.
# That's why we need to code a new method.

# Given Vector2 coordinates, calculates and returns the corresponding integer index. You can use
# this function to convert 2D coordinates to a 1D array's indices.
#
# There are two cases where you need to convert coordinates like so:
# 1. We'll need it for the AStar algorithm, which requires a unique index for each point on the
# graph it uses to find a path.
# 2. You can use it for performance. More on that below.
